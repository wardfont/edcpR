# Feedback Assignment 4

## First step of all analysis: data exploration

- Are there data types that don't make sense?
- Are there values that don't make sense?
- Are there missing values that can cause problems?

There were some pH values which were incorrect.

## Calculating Ellenberg values per plot

If there is a value for a species, it should be added proportionally to its cover.

## Relationship

- Small sample size (only 25 plots)
- Non-normal distribtuion (MIV_F and pH)
- Non-linearity of relationschips
- Ordinal values (mean still can be considered ordinal)

**Spearman** correlation is used for *both* pH and soil moisture

## Difference

- Small sample size
- Independent

**Kruskal-Wallis** with post-hoc **Dunn** test

## Other remarks

1 page = 1 page

"We followed the diagram" is not valid scientific reasoning.
