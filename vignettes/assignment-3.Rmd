  collapse = TRUE,

)
```

```{r setup}

```

Please complete the following problems.

Remember:

- R is case-sensitive. Make sure you store your answers using the exact name specified.
- You will be graded on:
  - The **correctness** of your answers.
  - The **efficiency** of your code. Don't make your script unnecessarily long and only do the essential steps.
  - The **clarity** of your code. Make sure you explain the steps in your script with annotations (`#`). Without comments, we don't know if you understand what is happening.

## Data

Load in the data you will need as follows:

```{r}
data(leuven_a3, nphk_a3,  package = "edcpR")
```

## Part 1

What can you tell on the species diversity in Leuven? 

- At plot level? Calculate all relevant indices. Make clear which index you calculate with annotations.
- Between plots? How many plot pairs are perfectly dissimilar? Which pair of distinct plots shows the highest similarity? Answer by means of annotations within your R-script!

## Part 2

Vegetation sampling has also been performed in the Hoge Kempen National Park (dataset `nphk_a3`) (a region to the North-West of Leuven). What can you say on the species diversity from that region compared to Leuven? Answer by means of annotations within your R-script!
